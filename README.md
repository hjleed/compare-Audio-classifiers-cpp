# Prerequisit: Install the two libraries

(A) Boost library (http://www.boost.org/):
--------------
Boost is a set of libraries for the C++ programming language that provide support for tasks and structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing, regular expressions, and unit testing. It contains over eighty individual libraries. (wiki)

(B) gesture-recognition-toolkit (GRT) (http://docsforge.com/7/grt/docs/latest/):
-------------------------
The Gesture Recognition Toolkit (GRT) is a cross-platform, open-source, c++ machine-learning library that has been specifically designed for real-time gesture recognition.
